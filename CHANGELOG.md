# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added Fastlane store metadata and F-Droid readiness notes for OSS app-store submission.
- Added dynamic smart playlist persistence and refresh for rule-based generated playlists.
- Added a Retry action to the album and artist detail screens when their content fails to load.
- Added an adjustable playback speed control (0.5×–2.0×, pitch-preserving) in Settings, applied across gapless transitions.
- Added a duplicate-track finder reachable from Settings → Sync &amp; scanning.

### Changed
- Removed bundled translations and the in-app language selector; the first public release ships with English resources only.
- Removed full-player expand background blur to reduce transition overhead.
- Release builds now stay unsigned when no local `keystore.properties` is present instead of relying on dummy signing values.
- Playlist sorting now runs off the main thread, and image loading reuses the app's shared HTTP client.
- Extracted smart-playlist selection into a unit-tested builder and translated leftover Spanish/Chinese source comments to English.

### Fixed
- Fixed debug lint blockers and several release-readiness warnings around locale-stable formatting and manifest labels.
- Unplayable tracks are now skipped with a brief notice instead of stalling the queue, and failed library syncs surface a message.
- Routed remaining raw `Log` calls and `printStackTrace()` swallows through Timber so they respect the release log filter.

### Security
- The loopback cloud-stream proxy now requires a per-session token, preventing other apps on the device from streaming the user's cloud library.
- Backup restore ignores preference keys owned by dedicated module handlers, and release builds no longer log HTTP request headers.

### Accessibility
- Shuffle/repeat/favorite toggles now announce their on/off state to TalkBack, and song rows expose a button role with click and long-press actions.

### Documentation
- Added release, privacy, and security documentation for the public repository.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a Dependabot config.

### Fixed

- **Stability:** Eliminated crashes on Android 12+, fixed memory leaks (ANRs), and improved exception handling in background services.
